# AED Final Project (Team 77) 

# Project Description
Everyday, in hospital all across the globe, Dog owners go through terrible news of their Pet being sick and in need of urgent or life saving treatment. There are only 3%-5% pet dogs insured. Very often stray dogs who are injured or sick have no-where to go to. There are NGO's out there to help them but even they lack resources to fulfill the medical and financial demands. Our initiative is to make a connected network that will address the issues with Pawcare System.
